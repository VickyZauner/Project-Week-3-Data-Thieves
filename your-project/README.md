## Project Description
Write a short introduction to your project: 3-5 sentences about the context of your topic and why you chose it.

## Questions & Hypotheses
What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data?

- What genre is experiencing the highest rise in awareness?
(Do men rather like fantasy, women like romance, do men cluster around a limited number of Series particularly and do women diversify more, who talks more about fiction books, do lifestyle accounts feature self-help books more often)
- Are people becoming more aware of books, is reading becoming more popular? (Rise of Audible, Blinkist, E-Books)
- Analyse the price distribution by genre, hardcover/ebook/ language and then popularity
- Is there a correlation between mentions of a book on Youtube and the occurence on best seller lists?
- What impact does this have on the price of books
- Optional: Focus on a specific Book and year.

## Dataset
What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What are the different sources you used (e.g. APIs, web scrapping, etc.)? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other?

## Workflow
We started out our brainstorming session with a browse trough open API's and decided to concentrate on three content fields. We wanted to find two intertwined topics and data sources to deversify our analysis. Eventually we decided to analyze the correlation of mentions on Youtube e.g. Social Media Marketing, Summaries, etc. and the actual sales/success of books by using APIs from publishers (and Amazon). For the first 3 days of the project, we sceduled daily meetings to discuss our findings and the next steps.

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?
We used a Trello board to keep track of our work progress and our tasks. 

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
